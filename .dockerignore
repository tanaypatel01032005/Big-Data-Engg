Data/
# embeddings/ (we want this!)
# Database/ (we want the initial empty DB or populated one?)
# Actually we want the populated DB if available, but usually distinct in prod.
# The user's DB has just been rebuilt with images, so we WANT valid data.
# BUT Data/ folder (CSV) is huge and not needed at runtime.
