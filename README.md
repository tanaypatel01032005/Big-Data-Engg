# BookFinder: University Library Enrichment System

---

## 📖 Introduction: The Problem & The Solution

**The Problem:**
University library datasets are often incomplete. Our raw data file (`dau_library_data.csv`) contained thousands of books with technical details (ISBN, Author, Year) but **missing descriptions**. Without a description, a library user can't know what a book is actually about.

**The Solution:**
**BookFinder** is an automated pipeline that fixes this. It acts as a "digital librarian" that:

1. **Reads** the messy library data
2. **Searches** external sources for missing book summaries
3. **Saves** the enriched data into a structured database
4. **Serves** the clean data to other applications via a website API

## 🏗️ Architecture: How It Works

This project uses an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline approach. We don't do everything in one file; responsibilities are clearly separated into distinct stages.

```

## 🧠 Core Components

### 1. The "Researcher" (`ingestion.py`)

**What it does:**
This script is the intelligence layer of the system.

**How it works:**
It reads the CSV file row by row and applies a **multi-stage enrichment strategy** for records with missing descriptions.

The enrichment follows a deterministic priority order:

1. **OpenLibrary lookup (ISBN-based)**
2. **Google Books HTML scraping (ISBN-based)**
3. **Google Books API fallback (title + author)**

Each subsequent method is used only if the previous one fails, ensuring high precision while maximizing coverage.
Requests are rate-limited to avoid blocking.

**Why we do this:**
Manual enrichment of thousands of records is infeasible. Real-world library data contains missing or malformed ISBNs, so a single source is insufficient. A fallback-based automated approach is required.

---

### 2. The "Librarian" (`SQLite3.py`)

**What it does:**
Handles persistent data storage.

**How it works:**
Takes the enriched CSV and loads it into a structured **relational SQLite database** (`db.sqlite3`).

**Why we do this:**
CSV files are inefficient for querying. A relational database enables fast lookups by ISBN or accession number and supports future extensions.

---

### 3. The "Receptionist" (`api.py`)

**What it does:**
Acts as the public interface to the system.

**How it works:**
Runs a FastAPI web server that executes SQL queries against the database and returns results in JSON format.

**Why we do this:**
Users and applications should not directly access database files. The API provides a safe, read-only access layer.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Concepts Learned

This project demonstrates several core software engineering skills:

* **Web Scraping:** Using `BeautifulSoup` to extract information from HTML pages
* **Data Cleaning:** Using `Pandas` to remove duplicates and handle missing values
* **Multi-source Fallback Strategy:** Sequential enrichment using OpenLibrary and Google Books
* **Rate-limited Scraping:** Preventing request blocking
* **Database Normalization:** Relational schema with primary keys
* **API Development:** RESTful endpoints using FastAPI
* **Separation of Concerns:** Modular, single-purpose scripts
* **CLI-driven Pipelines:** Reproducible execution via command-line arguments

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Clean and standardize raw library data
* Handle duplicate and inconsistent ISBN values
* Enrich missing book descriptions using multiple external sources
* Merge enriched data into a single canonical dataset
* Store structured data in a relational database
* Provide REST API access to the enriched dataset

## 📋 Data Files Description

### `dau_library_data.csv`

Raw library dataset containing accession details, titles, ISBNs, authors, publishers, year, pages, and classification numbers.
Contains **duplicate records and missing descriptions**.

### `FinalDATA.csv`

Enriched dataset generated by `ingestion.py`, ready for database insertion.

---

## 🔄 Data Enrichment Workflow

1. Load raw library records
2. Remove duplicate entries
3. Identify records with missing descriptions
4. Query **OpenLibrary** using ISBN
5. Fallback to **Google Books HTML scraping**
6. Final fallback using **Google Books API (title + author)**
7. Clean and normalize extracted text
8. Merge successful enrichments
9. Export final enriched CSV

## 🗄️ Database Design

**Database:** `db.sqlite3`
**Script:** `Database/SQLite3.py`

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books (
    Acc_Date TEXT,
    Acc_No INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Title TEXT,
    ISBN TEXT,
    Author_Editor TEXT,
    Edition_Volume TEXT,
    Place_Publisher TEXT,
    Year INTEGER,
    Pages TEXT,
